# Troubleshoot an app in AKS

In this exercise, you practice diagnosing and fixing common issues with applications running on Azure Kubernetes Service. You deploy a mock API, intentionally break it in several ways, and use `kubectl` commands to identify and resolve each problem.

**Estimated time:** 30-40 minutes

## Task 1: Verify the deployment (~5 minutes)

In this task, you confirm the application deployed by the setup script is running correctly.

1. Run the deployment script and complete options 1-6 to provision Azure resources and deploy the application. This process takes approximately 10-15 minutes.

    - **Bash (Linux/macOS):** `bash azdeploy.sh`
    - **PowerShell (Windows/Linux/macOS):** `pwsh azdeploy.ps1`

1. Verify that the pod is running and the Service has endpoints.

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n aks-troubleshoot
    kubectl get endpointslices -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    You should see one pod in `Running` status and one endpoint slice listed.

1. Test connectivity with port-forward.

    ```
    kubectl port-forward service/api-service 8080:80 -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. In a separate terminal on your workstation, send a test request.

    - **Bash/macOS/Linux:** `curl http://localhost:8080/healthz`
    - **PowerShell:** `Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8080/healthz`

    You should receive a JSON response with `"status": "healthy"`.

1. Stop the port-forward (Ctrl+C) before continuing to the troubleshooting tasks.

## Task 2: Diagnose a label mismatch (~7 minutes)

A Service routes traffic to pods based on label selectors. When labels don't match, the Service has no endpoints and requests fail.

1. Apply the deployment configuration that introduces a label mismatch error.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f k8s/task2-label-mismatch-deployment.yaml -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. Wait for the new pod to start, then check the Service endpoint slices.

    ```
    kubectl get pods --show-labels -n aks-troubleshoot
    kubectl get endpointslices -l kubernetes.io/service-name=api-service -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    Notice the endpoint slice shows no addresses.

1. Compare the Service selector with the pod labels.

    ```
    kubectl describe service api-service -n aks-troubleshoot
    kubectl get pods --show-labels -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    Look for the `Selector` field in the Service description and compare it to the pod labels.

1. Fix the issue by editing the Deployment to change the pod label back to `app: api`.

    ```
    kubectl edit deployment api-deployment -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    In the editor, find the `labels` section under `spec.template.metadata` and `spec.selector.matchLabels`, change `app: api-v2` back to `app: api`. Save and exit the editor.

1. Verify the endpoint slice addresses are restored.

    ```
    kubectl get endpointslices -l kubernetes.io/service-name=api-service -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

## Task 3: Diagnose a CrashLoopBackOff (~8 minutes)

When a container fails to start, Kubernetes repeatedly restarts it, resulting in `CrashLoopBackOff` status. Reading logs reveals why the application crashed.

1. Apply the deployment configuration that removes the required `API_KEY` environment variable.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f k8s/task3-crashloop-deployment.yaml -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. Watch the pod status.

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n aks-troubleshoot -w
    ```

    After a few moments, the pod enters `CrashLoopBackOff`.

1. Check the pod logs for the error message.

    ```
    kubectl logs <pod-name> -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    You should see an error indicating the missing environment variable.

1. Inspect the pod events for additional context.

    ```
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. Fix the issue by editing the Deployment to add the `API_KEY` environment variable.

    ```
    kubectl edit deployment api-deployment -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    In the editor, add the following under `spec.template.spec.containers[0]`:

    ```yaml
    env:
    - name: API_KEY
      value: "demo-api-key-12345"
    ```

    Save and exit the editor.

1. Verify the pod returns to `Running` status.

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

## Task 4: Diagnose a port mismatch (~7 minutes)

When the Service targetPort doesn't match the container's listening port, connections are refused even though the pod is running.

1. Apply the service configuration that introduces a port mismatch error.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f k8s/task4-port-mismatch-service.yaml -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. Attempt to connect via port-forward.

    ```
    kubectl port-forward service/api-service 8080:80 -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. In a separate terminal, send a request.

    - **Bash/macOS/Linux:** `curl http://localhost:8080/healthz`
    - **PowerShell:** `Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8080/healthz`

    The connection is refused, even though the pod shows `Running`.

1. Use `kubectl exec` to test the port from inside the container.

    ```
    kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n aks-troubleshoot -- wget -qO- http://localhost:8000/healthz
    ```

    This works because you're connecting directly to the container's actual port.

1. Fix the Service by editing it to set `targetPort` back to `8000`.

    ```
    kubectl edit service api-service -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    In the editor, find `targetPort: 9000` and change it to `targetPort: 8000`. Save and exit the editor.

1. Test again with port-forward to confirm connectivity is restored.

## Task 5: Diagnose a readiness probe failure (~8 minutes)

When a readiness probe fails, the pod shows `Running` but `0/1` containers are ready. Kubernetes removes the pod from the Service endpoints, so no traffic is routed to it.

1. Apply the deployment configuration that introduces a readiness probe failure.

    ```
    kubectl apply -f k8s/task5-probe-failure-deployment.yaml -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. Watch the pod status.

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    The pod shows `Running` but `0/1` in the READY column.

1. Check the pod events for probe failures.

    ```
    kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    Look for `Readiness probe failed` in the Events section.

1. Verify the Service endpoint slice has no addresses.

    ```
    kubectl get endpointslices -l kubernetes.io/service-name=api-service -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. Fix the readiness probe by editing the Deployment to correct the path.

    ```
    kubectl edit deployment api-deployment -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

    In the editor, find the `readinessProbe` section and change `path: /invalid-path` to `path: /healthz`. Save and exit the editor.

1. Verify the pod becomes ready and endpoint slice addresses are restored.

    ```
    kubectl get pods -n aks-troubleshoot
    kubectl get endpointslices -l kubernetes.io/service-name=api-service -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

## Task 6: Verify end-to-end connectivity (~5 minutes)

After completing all troubleshooting scenarios, confirm the application is fully functional.

1. Use port-forward to access the Service.

    ```
    kubectl port-forward service/api-service 8080:80 -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

1. In a separate terminal, test all endpoints.

    - **Bash/macOS/Linux:**

        ```
        curl http://localhost:8080/healthz
        curl http://localhost:8080/readyz
        curl http://localhost:8080/api/info
        ```

    - **PowerShell:**

        ```powershell
        Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8080/healthz
        Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8080/readyz
        Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8080/api/info
        ```

1. Check the pod logs to see the requests.

    ```
    kubectl logs <pod-name> -n aks-troubleshoot
    ```

## Summary

In this exercise, you practiced four common troubleshooting scenarios:

| Scenario | Symptom | Key Commands |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Label mismatch | Service has no endpoints | `kubectl get endpointslices`, `kubectl describe svc` |
| CrashLoopBackOff | Pod repeatedly restarts | `kubectl logs`, `kubectl describe pod` |
| Port mismatch | Connection refused, pod running | `kubectl exec`, compare Service and container ports |
| Readiness probe failure | Pod running but 0/1 ready | `kubectl describe pod`, check Events section |

These diagnostic techniques apply to any application running on Kubernetes, regardless of the workload type.
